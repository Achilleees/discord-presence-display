## Error Handling

### Silent Discord failures are intentional
- **Location:** codebase-wide (`src/discord-client.ts`, `src/extension.ts`)
- **Pattern:** `.catch(() => {})`, empty catch blocks, no user-visible error reporting
- **Why it's correct:** Project invariant -- "Discord is optional...never surfaces errors to the user." All Discord operations are fire-and-forget with silent fallbacks.

## Data Structures

### `sameStringSet` assumes deduplicated inputs
- **Location:** `src/transitions.ts`
- **Pattern:** `sameStringSet(a, b)` could be fooled by duplicate entries in `a`
- **Why it's correct:** `sanitizeCustomWords` deduplicates before values reach config, so the path cannot trigger with duplicate inputs.

## Library Patterns

### Optional chaining on `client.user` follows library convention
- **Location:** `src/discord-client.ts:97`, `src/discord-client.ts:107`
- **Pattern:** `c.user?.setActivity(...)`, `c.user?.clearActivity(...)`
- **Why it's correct:** The `@xhayper/discord-rpc` library types `user` as `ClientUser | undefined` and its own README uses `client.user?.setActivity(...)`. The optional chaining is the expected access pattern. NOTE: the *return value semantics* of `pushPresence` when `user` is undefined are a separate concern (see finding 3.1 in audit-2026-04-20.md) -- the chaining itself is not the bug.
- **Verified:** 2026-04-20

### `clearPresence` void return is acceptable given library call ordering
- **Location:** `src/discord-client.ts:105-109`
- **Pattern:** `clearPresence()` returns `void` and uses optional chaining `c.user?.clearActivity()` without reporting whether the clear succeeded.
- **Why it's correct:** All call sites in `extension.ts` that invoke `clearPresence` are reachable only after the library's "ready" event fires, at which point `client.user` is already populated. The `@xhayper/discord-rpc` library sets `user` from the DISPATCH/READY message synchronously before emitting "connected", and `login()` without scopes emits "ready" immediately after. There is no production code path where `clearPresence` runs with `isConnected=true` but `user=undefined`. The asymmetry with `pushPresence` (which returns `boolean`) is a style choice, not a bug. If this is ever revisited, it should be treated as a LOW-priority defensive hardening, not a HIGH-severity issue.

## Naming / Comments

### Smart-state rule numbering differs between README and internal code
- **Location:** `src/state.ts:19-21`, `test/presence.test.ts:126-181`, `README.md:58-67`
- **Pattern:** README uses a simplified 1-4 numbering (debug=1, diff=2, terminal=3, working=4). Internal code and tests use a fuller scheme (rule 2=debug, rule 3=diff, rule 4=terminal, rule 5=undefined-language, rule 6=working) that includes implementation-only steps not relevant to end users.
- **Why it's correct:** The README numbering is a user-facing simplification that intentionally omits internal-only rules (rule 1: showLanguage=false gate, rule 5: undefined language fallback). The `state.ts` comments and `presence.test.ts` test names use the same internal numbering and are consistent with each other. Two numbering schemes (user-facing vs internal) is normal for documented software.
